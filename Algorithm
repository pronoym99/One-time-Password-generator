The basic algorithm behind this random password generator is as follows:
Create lists containing the following uppercase alphabets,lowercase alphabets,numbers and special characters.
Combine all the lists to form a mega list.
Ask the user for no. of characters required in the password
Now initiate a loop so that legth of the password remains less then the value specified
Use the random module in python to randomly access index of lists and keep on adding them to a empty strings till the desired length is reached (using the while loop)
